# Data Science Project for Internship

Welcome to my Data Science project for an internship! In this project, I utilize Python along with Excel to analyze and visualize data for various data science tasks. Whether you're an aspiring data scientist looking to gain practical experience or an intern eager to learn and contribute, you're in the right place.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on leveraging Python and Excel for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization. Here's what it covers:

- **Data Collection:** Gathering data from various sources or using sample datasets.
- **Data Cleaning:** Preprocessing the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- **Data Analysis:** Exploring and analyzing the data using statistical methods and machine learning techniques.
- **Data Visualization:** Creating insightful visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
- **Excel Integration:** Integrating Python with Excel for tasks such as data import/export, automation, and reporting.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Python:** Programming language for data analysis and manipulation.
- **Excel:** Spreadsheet software for data visualization and reporting.
- **Pandas:** Python library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** Python library for numerical computing.
- **Matplotlib:** Python library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- **Seaborn:** Python library for statistical data visualization.
- **Plotly:** Python library for interactive and web-based visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Interactive computing environment for Python.
